Transparent Hybrid Non-Volatile Memory (ThyNVM)

A gem5-based simulator of a memory controller for the DRAM+NVM hybrid
architecture. ThyNVM supports software-transparent crash consistency via an
efficient dual-scheme checkpointing mechanism.

For more information about ThyNVM, please visit: http://persper.com/thynvm. Our
paper, documents and slides demonstrate advantages of and describe the details
of the design of ThyNVM. 

NOTE: The code is being ported to the latest gem5 version. This repository is
under construction. Please stay tuned for the new version of ThyNVM.

Before the repository is ready, you may refer to my old code: https://github.com/basicthinker/Sexain-MemController.

Below is the original README of gem5.

==========

This is the gem5 simulator.

The main website can be found at http://www.gem5.org

A good starting point is http://www.gem5.org/Introduction, and for
more information about building the simulator and getting started
please see http://www.gem5.org/Documentation and
http://www.gem5.org/Tutorials.

To build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,
Python (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, SWIG, zlib, m4,
and lastly protobuf if you want trace capture and playback
support. Please see http://www.gem5.org/Dependencies for more details
concerning the minimum versions of the aforementioned tools.

Once you have all dependencies resolved, type 'scons
build/<ARCH>/gem5.opt' where ARCH is one of ALPHA, ARM, NULL, MIPS,
POWER, SPARC, or X86. This will build an optimized version of the gem5
binary (gem5.opt) for the the specified architecture. See
http://www.gem5.org/Build_System for more details and options.

With the simulator built, have a look at
http://www.gem5.org/Running_gem5 for more information on how to use
gem5.

The basic source release includes these subdirectories:
   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts
   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5
   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator
   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems
   - tests: regression tests
   - util: useful utility programs and files

To run full-system simulations, you will need compiled system firmware
(console and PALcode for Alpha), kernel binaries and one or more disk
images. Please see the gem5 download page for these items at
http://www.gem5.org/Download

If you have questions, please send mail to gem5-users@gem5.org

Enjoy using gem5 and please share your modifications and extensions.
